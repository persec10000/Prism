When we lay on our side, the highest pressure points are on our hips and shoulders. This pressure firstly restricts our blood flow (you may have noticed that you sometimes wake with pins &amp; needles or a numb arm). This pressure also creates heat (as on all mattresses), and&nbsp;because the memory mattress reacts to heat, it softens more in just those areas. This results in a more even weight distribution over the length of the mattress, therefore&nbsp;less pressure, so reducing 'toss and turn'&nbsp;during the night.&nbsp;Reduced movement means more non-REM sleep (the deep sleep our body needs to rejuvenate itself), which is why it is perfect for sleeping on.</p><p><strong><span style='color: #0000ff;'>“Cool Foam Mattress”</span></strong> this mattress can have castling as shown in the picture below, which allows the air to be drawn in to flow through the mattress and keep you cool as you turn in bed. It also has open cell technology, again for breathe-ability, which will keep your body at an even temperature throughout the night. The removable washable cover is made from double stretch cotton, which allows maximum ventilation and helps any moisture evaporate quickly.<br><br></p><p><strong><span style='color: #993300;'>Each mattress is made individually for you and to YOUR WEIGHT, so if you have a dual bed and one person is 10 stone, the other 18 stone and both want a medium feel, they will be different mattresses.
