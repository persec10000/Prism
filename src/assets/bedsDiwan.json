Our new Carers mobiltiy bed can be raised flat for the carers to wash or turn the patient, or it can be used to help&nbsp;the person&nbsp;stand out of the bed like a riser recliner chair (must be sat on the edge (in the middle section) of the bed),&nbsp;or it can be raised whilst adjusted at the head and foot-end to get a comfortable high position to look out of the window.</p><p><br>The single vertical lifting frame can be put into any of our adjustable bed surrounds, so choose the bed you like (from the home page) and add the vertical lifting frame (in the <strong>mechanisms</strong> tab drop down), this will add the cost of the mechanism to any bed, or choose the combination as shown on this page.</p><p><strong>Bed height Breakdown</strong><br>Standard size for the Helston Carers Bed is 23 inches from the floor to the top of the mattress.</p><p>Purchasing any Sprung Mattress (Pocket or Superior) may increase the overall bed height.</p><p>To make sure the height of your bed is correct when ordering, please measure your own first.
