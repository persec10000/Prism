This bed has separate motors to profile the bed at the head-end or the foot-end, and again separate motors to vertically raise the bed up to 18 inches from the starting position (standard height; 23 inches). Our new Carers mobiltiy bed can be raised flat for the carers to wash or turn the patient, or it can be used to help&nbsp;the person&nbsp;stand out of the bed like a riser recliner chair (must be sat on the edge (in the middle section) of the bed),&nbsp;or it can be raised whilst adjusted at the head and foot-end to get a comfortable high position to look out of the window.</p><p><br>The single vertical lifting frame can be put into any of our adjustable bed surrounds, so choose the bed you like (from the home page) and add the vertical lifting frame (in the <strong>mechanisms</strong> tab drop down), this will add the cost of the mechanism to any bed, or choose the combination as shown on this page.</p><p><strong>Bed height Breakdown</strong><br>Standard size for the Helston Carers Bed is 23 inches from the floor to the top of the mattress.</p><p>Purchasing any Sprung Mattress (Pocket or Superior) may increase the overall bed height.</p><p>To make sure the height of your bed is correct when ordering, please measure your own first. We are able to alter your bed to a height of your choice, and all for an extra £75!</p><p style='font-weight: bold;'>Altering the length means altering the mattress, mattress cover, mechanism and surround</p><div>Dual bed altering the length<strong> £ 295</strong></div><p>Altering the height of bed&nbsp;<strong>£&nbsp;75</strong></p><div><strong>Bed Length</strong></div><p>The length of the carers' mobility bed is 6ft 8'. The standard length can be adjusted (for standard height alteration cost).</p><div><p><strong>Description</strong></p></div><p>• 5 part adjustable profiling with integral raise and lower facility<br>• 4 motors (2 for profiling and 2 for lift)<br>• Vertical rise up to 18 inches from starting point<br>• Twin On-Line fittings<br>• Weight adjuster zone lumber section<br>• Centre belt<br>• Load bearing points bolted and sleeved<br>•&nbsp;<strong>Special order </strong><strong>(may take upto 1 wk longer to make)</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Dual beds</strong> have independent controls and independant matttresses. You will generally have a vertical lifting mechanism on one side of a dual carers' mobility bed, so if you are&nbsp;purchasing a&nbsp;5ft dual bed you will only need&nbsp;one 2ft 6 vertical lifting mechanism.</p></div>"
